                What is the next logical step for someone who grew up in a restaurant, got a degree in Musical Theatre, worked in IT, bartended, and sold cars and windows?

                Software Development, obviously!

            Throughout my life, I have been interested in technology. As a kid, my stepdad and I dissected computers and appliances in our garage. This instilled in me a lifelong curiosity of technology and finding out how things fit together. As a result, I usually ended up becoming the 'go-to' tech guy, whether it was the theatre or sales floor. After a few years in sales and saving enough money, I knew exactly what I wanted to pursue next--software development. That's how I ended up at Flatiron. 
            Now that graduation is behind me, I could not be more excited to continue combining my technical abilities with my creative background. My unique skills and experience will help companies exceed customer expectations, as well as increase a programming team's efficiency by setting and achieving measurable goals inside and out of the office.
